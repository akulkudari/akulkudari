## About Me

Hello there! My name is Akul Kudari, and I am currently a 4th year Computer Engineering Student at UC San Diego. I have a broad variety of interests including AI/Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Embedded Systems Design, VLSI Design and CMOS Digital Design, Computer Architecture, FPGA Programming, and SoC Design. Some of my best projects and repositories are pinned below. 

In addition to being an aspiring engineer and voracious learner of all things computing, I enjoy working out in my free time, as well as reading comic books and manga. Some of my favorites include Batman: Year One, All Star Superman, Invincible, and my favorite, One Piece.
