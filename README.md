# Hi, I'm Akul 👋

I'm an engineering student with a strong interest in building **end-to-end systems** that span hardware, firmware, backend software, and intelligent data processing. I enjoy working close to the metal, designing reliable systems, and then scaling them upward into usable products.

I learn best by building — from embedded devices and FPGA logic to backend APIs and data-driven applications.
